## Data, Information and Knowledge
#### 1. What is data?
Data is unprocessed, unoraginzed and meaningless information, so the data itself does not give us anything useable information unless combining it into a specific context
For example: If somebody give us a number 38 degree ceilsus, it gives us no more information except the temperature. Unless putting it into a specific context, it is weather of a place or someone's temparature.
