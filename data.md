# Data, Information and Knowledge
## Data
#### 1. Definition of Data
Data refers to raw, unprocessed, and unorganized information that, by itself, lacks meaning. Data becomes valuable when contextualized or processed to derive meaningful insights.

Example: Consider the temperature reading of 38 degrees Celsius. This data point, on its own, conveys little information. However, when placed in a specific context, such as the weather in a particular location or an individual's body temperature, it becomes meaningful.

#### 2. Types of Data

Data can be broadly categorized into two types: structured and unstructured data. Structured data follows a predefined format, while unstructured data lacks a specific format. Additionally, data can be classified as ordinal or nominal based on its characteristics.

#### 3. Sources of Data

Data can originate from various sources in our surroundings, including devices, activities, the environment, and more. It is the raw material from which information and knowledge are derived.
