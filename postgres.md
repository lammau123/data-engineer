#### 1. Introduction
Database is a collection of information which are stored in some specific structures. These structures are supported by database management system (DBMS), which is responsible for managing the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in the database.
Some common types of databases:

Postgres is an Object-Relational Database (ORD). It combines the features of both relational and object-oriented databases, which means that objects, classes, and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language.
